Hi there. I'm Levi. I'm a Full Stack developer from Los Angeles, California, loving my job at [Clicktripz](https://www.clicktripz.com). I blog about Web development and Machine Learning. I love JavaScript and Python. I think about DevOps, Software Development Management, Automation, and scoring buckets üèÄ.
