Hi there. I'm Levi. I'm a Full Stack developer from Los Angeles, California, loving my job at [Clicktripz](https://www.clicktripz.com). I blog about Web development and Machine Learning. I love JavaScript and Python. I'm constantly coming up with new ideas about how to use technology, integrating those ideas into software development teams, and automation. I'm looking forward to sharing them and getting feedback from the interwebz.
